<h3>Module description</h3>

<p>
    In <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs118/">CS118</a> you have learnt to write programs in the eager, object-oriented style using Java. However, Java is just one of many programming languages and object-oriented programming is just one of many programming paradigms. You may think of programming languages as tools: a hammer is different from a screwdriver and both serve different purposes which they are good at. Programming languages are the same: different languages exist for different purposes and it is easier or harder to accomplish certain tasks in one or the other. As a Computer Scientist, you need to know which tools are at your disposal and when to use them.
</p>

<p>
    In this module, you will learn about the functional programming paradigm. For this, we will use <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, which is a lazy, purely functional programming language. Writing programs in Haskell is very different than writing programs in Java and over the course of this module you will learn how to do that. In turn, this adds a powerful tool to your programming arsenal, you will gain a much deeper understanding of programming, and skills from this module can be applied in other languages, functional or not. In other words, you will become a better programmer!
</p>

<h3>Lectures</h3>

<p>
    There are 19 lectures in Term 1 and there will be additional revision lectures in Term 3. Lectures are timetabled in CS1.04 for Mondays at 10:00 (starting in Week 2) and Tuesdays at 15:00 (starting in Week 1).

<h3>Labs</h3>

<p>
    There are nine lab sessions for this module. There are two groups the labs: one on Mondays and one on Tuesdays, both at 16:00 in CS0.01. You are free to join either group through Tabula, but try to keep numbers evenly balanced.

<h3>Coursework</h3>

<p>
    There are two pieces of coursework for this module which are worth 15% and 25% of the overall module mark, respectively. Submissions should be made through Tabula for which the links are below. You can access the descriptions and the skeleton codes for both pieces of coursework straight away and are free to work on them anytime before the respective deadlines, but there is one briefing lecture for each piece of coursework (see above) which provide useful advice.

<h3>Exam</h3>

<p>
    There is a 2 hour exam in Term 3 which is worth 60% of the overall module mark. You will have to answer any FOUR out of six questions. A sample exam paper with that structure will be available below shortly.

    This module was taught by Steve Matthews until the 2016/17 academic year. Past papers from this time are available below, but note that their structure and content is different from what you will be asked to do:
